# Packer

Packer is a JavaScript library for Node.js built with TypeScript that allows you to determine which items to put into the package with highest value without overloading the package. So the total weight is within the specified limit but the total value is as high as possible. You just have to provide the absolute path to a file that includes the items to choose from, and we will find which things to put in the package.

# Installation (only after publishing as a npm package)

    npm install mobiq-packer

# Development

To setup this mobiq-packer locally, you just have to build the app running below script. And then go to the project you need to import this and `npm link`.

This will compile the typescript files to `/dist` folder.

    npm run build

This will compile the typescript files in watch mode

    npm run build:watch

Then go to the node.js application you want to use this library and run the below script

    npm link {root path of mobiq-packer}

# Testing

Run unit tests

    npm test

Run test in watch mode

    npm run test:watch
